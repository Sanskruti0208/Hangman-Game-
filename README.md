# Hangman Game

A classic Hangman game implemented using Python and Pygame. The game allows users to guess letters to reveal a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The project features interactive elements, including dynamic button generation, fade-in animations for the hangman image, and a sparkle effect for correct guesses.
